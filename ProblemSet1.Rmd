# I. Evaluating the impact of different missing data mechanisms within a randomized trial

# Q1

1.  Write an R function to simulate a randomized trial of patients from
    the population defined above. Set the inputs to the R function as: n
    (the total sample size of the trial), and delta (the treatment
    effect, i.e. the improvement in the QOL scores when the patient's
    surgery is performed under the novel protocol vs. standard of care).
    An outline of the R function is given below:

```{r}
expit <- function(x) {
  exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))
  }

my.sim <- function(n , delta ){
  sigma <- matrix(c(16,5,5,6), ncol=2)
  data <- rmvnorm(n, mean=c(65,10), sigma=sigma)
  e <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 3)
  age <- data[ , 1]
  severity <- data[ , 2]
  Y0 <- 75 - 0.35 * (age -65) - 0.15 * (severity -10) + e 
  Y1 <- Y0 + delta
  # c.	Randomly assign patients to receive the standard of care or novel protocol.  HINT:  Define the treatment indicator as A
  A = rbinom(n,1,prob=0.5)
  # d.	Define the outcome as Y = A * Y1 + (1-A) * Y0 
  Y =  A * Y1 + (1-A) * Y0 
  # e.	Estimate the marginal treatment effect under no missing data; trteffect0 = lm(Y~A)$coeff[2]
  trteffect0 = lm(Y~A)$coeff[2]

  # f.	For values j = 1, 2, 3, 4, generate R_j, the indicator that the patient did not return for their 1-month assessment which is generated as rbinom(n,size=1,prob=pj), where pj is a vector of probabilities defined by the models below.
    R_1 = rbinom(n,size=1,prob= 0.15)
    x2 = -1.75 + 0.5 * (age-65) + 0.02 * (severity - 10)
    R_2 = rbinom(n,size=1,prob= expit(x2))
    x3 = -1.75 + 0.5 * (1-A) * (age-65) + 0.01 * A * (age - 65) + 0.02 * (severity - 10)
    R_3 = rbinom(n,size=1,prob= expit(x3))
    x4 = -1.75 + 0.35 * (1-A) * (Y-75)
    R_4 = rbinom(n,size=1,prob= expit(x4))

    # g.	Create Y_j = Y with values set to NA for patients with R_j = 1
    Y_1 = ifelse(R_1 == 1, NA, Y)
    Y_2 = ifelse(R_2 == 1, NA, Y)
    Y_3 = ifelse(R_3 == 1, NA, Y)
    Y_4 = ifelse(R_4 == 1, NA, Y)
    # h.	Estimate the marginal treatment effect under the four missing data models, e.g. trteffect1 = lm(Y_1 ~ A,na.action=na.omit)$coeff[2]
    trteffect1 = lm(Y_1 ~ A,na.action=na.omit)$coeff[2]
    trteffect2 = lm(Y_2 ~ A,na.action=na.omit)$coeff[2]
    trteffect3 = lm(Y_3 ~ A,na.action=na.omit)$coeff[2]
    trteffect4 = lm(Y_4 ~ A,na.action=na.omit)$coeff[2]
    # i.	Have the function output trteffect0, trteffect1, â€¦, trteffect4 
    return(c(trteffect0, trteffect1, trteffect2, trteffect3, trteffect4))
}
```

# Q2

2.  Using the function you created above, perform a simulation study:
    simulate 5,000 randomized trials of 250 patients assuming a marginal
    treatment effect of 3. Separately for each of the missing data
    conditions (i.e. no missing data and models 1 through 4), estimate
    the bias (sample mean of the 5,000 estimates minus delta), variance
    (sample variance of the 5,000 estimates) and mean squared error
    (bias\^2 + variance) of the marginal treatment effects. Compute the
    relative mean squared error comparing the estimator under no missing
    data (numerator) to the estimators generated under the missing data
    models (denominator).

```{r}
# Simulation parameters
K <- 5000
n_patients <- 250
delta <- 3

# Simulation results storage
results <- matrix(NA, ncol=5, nrow=K)

# Running the simulation
set.seed(123)
for (i in 1:K) {
  results[i, ] <- my.sim(n_patients, delta)
}

# Calculate Bias, Variance, and MSE
estimated_means <- colMeans(results)
biases <- estimated_means - delta
variances <- apply(results, 2, var)
mses <- biases^2 + variances
# Calculate relative MSE
relative_mse <- mses[1] / mses


results <- data.frame(
"Missing Data Conditions" = c("No Missing Data", "Model 1", "Model 2", "Model 3", "Model4"),
"Means" = estimated_means,
"Bias" = biases,
"Variance" = variances,
"Mean Squared Error" = mses,
"Relative Mean Squared Error" = relative_mse
)
results
```

### Summarize your findings in 1 or 2 paragraphs.

For each of the missing data conditions, we estimate the bias (sample
mean of the 5,000 estimates minus delta), mean squared error, variance,
and mean squared error of the marginal treatment effects. We could see
the smallest bias, variance and mean squared error when there is no
missing data. Then for the other four missing data conditions that the
patient did not return for their 1-month assessment, the bias and mean
squared error were lower in model 1 and the highest in model 4. Model 1
means the probability that patient did not return is 0.15 and the cause
of missingness is unrelated to the observed data. Model 4 is a condition
that the probabilities of patient did not return for their 1-month
assessment dependent on both the treatment A and outcome Y. Missing data
under this condition may be more likely due to the side-effect of
treatment, lower the accuracy of the estimate of marginal treatment
effect. For the relative mean squared error (RMSE) comparing the
estimator under no missing data (numerator) to the estimators generated
under the missing data models (denominator), we could see the model 4
has the lowest RMSE. The low RMSE imply the estimate is biased. This
simulation study tells us the importance of considering the mechanisms
of missing data.

# II. Analyze a dataset with missing data

## 1. Conduct an exploratory analysis of the missing data in your trial. Compute the proportion of missing outcomes (overall and within treatment group).

```{r}
data <- read_csv("/Users/zousiyu/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-JohnsHopkins/Term 4/bios_654/Homework/Problemset1/stroketrial.csv")


md.pattern(data)

prop_missing_overall <-  sum(is.na(data$Y)) /  nrow(data)
print(prop_missing_overall)

data %>%
  group_by(A) %>%
  summarise(
    Prevalence = sum(is.na(Y)) / n() )
```

The proportion of missing outcomes is 0.124 overall, 0.173 for standard
of care, 0.073 for the treatment group (surgery)

### Look at the distribution of age and severity for those with and without missing data (overall and within treatment group).

```{r}
# Overall
updata <- data |>
  mutate(
    Y_missing = ifelse(is.na(Y) == T, 1, 0)
  )

updata |>
  group_by(Y_missing) |> 
  summarise(Age_mean = mean(age),
            Age_sd = sd(age),
            Severity_mean = mean(severity), 
            Severity_sd = sd(severity))

ggplot(data, aes(x = age, fill = is.na(Y))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age for Missing vs. Non-missing Data")

ggplot(data, aes(x = severity, fill = is.na(Y))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Severity for Missing vs. Non-missing Data")
```

```{r}
## Within treatment group
updata |>
  group_by( A, Y_missing) |> 
  summarise(Age_mean = mean(age),
            Age_sd = sd(age),
            Severity_mean = mean(severity), 
            Severity_sd = sd(severity))

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = is.na(Y))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ A) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Treatment Group")

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = severity, fill = is.na(Y))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ A) +
  labs(title = "Severity Distribution by Treatment Group")



```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Create custom theme
custom_theme <- theme(
  panel.background = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
  axis.line = element_line(size = 0.5)
)

# Scatterplot for age
updata <- data |>
  mutate(
    Y_missing = ifelse(is.na(Y) == T, 1, 0)
  )

scatter_age <- ggplot(updata, aes(x = age, y =Y_missing)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgray") +
  geom_smooth( method = "loess",color = "#024873", se = FALSE) +
  custom_theme

scatter_severity <- ggplot(updata, aes(x = severity, y = Y_missing)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgray") +
  geom_smooth( method = "loess",color = "#024873", se = FALSE) +
  custom_theme

library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(scatter_age, scatter_severity, nrow = 1,
             top=textGrob("Missing of Y by age and severity", 
                          gp = gpar(fontsize = 14, fontface = "bold")))
```

## 2. Based on your exploratory analysis, specify a model for Y to be used in a single and multiple (M = 20) predicted mean imputation.

From the exploratory analyses, we observed that the proportion of
missing outcomes is 0.124 overall, higher among standard care (0.173)
compared to the treatment group (0.073). When plotting missingness of
outcomes against age and severity, the distribution of age and servity
are different for missing vs. non-missing data overall or in treatment
group, indicating that these variables may influence the missingness.
This suggests that age, severity, and treatment assignment should be
considered as factors in the imputation models.

```{r}
#  Single predicted mean
imp_predmean <- mice(data[,-1], method = "norm", 
                     m = 1, seed = 654, maxit = 50, print = F)
# multiple (M = 20) predicted mean imputation.
imp_mi <- mice(data[,-1], method = "norm",
               m = 20, maxit = 50, seed = 654, print = F)
```

## 3. Estimate the marginal treatment effect, with a 95% confidence interval, using the complete cases and the data from the single and multiple imputation. Compare the estimates and whether the data supports a benefit to quality of life of the novel targeted blood pressure management protocol compared to the standard of care.

```{r}
# Complete case analysis
fit_compcase <- lm(Y ~ as.factor(A), na.action=na.omit, data = data)
summary(fit_compcase)
ci_compcase <- confint(fit_compcase)["as.factor(A)1", ]


# Single predicted mean
data_predmean <- data
data_predmean$Y_impute <- mice::complete(imp_predmean)$Y
fit_predmean <- lm(Y_impute ~ as.factor(A), data = data_predmean)
summary(fit_predmean)
ci_predmean <- confint(fit_predmean)["as.factor(A)1", ]



# Multiple imputation
data_imp_mi <- mice::complete(imp_mi, action = "long", include = TRUE)
# Save as mids object
data_imp_mi <- as.mids(data_imp_mi)
# Run the models using mice function with
fit_imp_mi <- with(data_imp_mi, lm(Y ~ as.factor(A)))
# Pool the estimates
summary_multiple <- summary(pool(fit_imp_mi))


ci_multiple <- c((summary_multiple$estimate[2]-1.96*summary_multiple$std.error[2]
),
(summary_multiple$estimate[2]+1.96*summary_multiple$std.error[2]
))


# Combine altogether in one table
imp_results <- 
  data.frame(model = c("Complete case", "Single predicted mean", "Multiple predicted mean"),
             beta = unlist(c(coef(fit_compcase)[2], 
                             coef(fit_predmean)[2],
                             summary(pool(fit_imp_mi))[2,2])),
             se = unlist(c(sqrt(diag(vcov(fit_compcase)))[2], 
                           sqrt(diag(vcov(fit_predmean)))[2],
                           summary(pool(fit_imp_mi))[2,3])),
             LowerCI = unlist(round(c(ci_compcase[1], 
                                      ci_predmean[1], 
                                      ci_multiple[1]),3)),
             UpperCI = unlist(round(c(ci_compcase[2], 
                                      ci_predmean[2], 
                                      ci_multiple[2]),3))
             )

# Combine altogether in one table

imp_results

kable(imp_results, caption = "Marginal Treatment Effect Estimates with 95% CIs")

```

The marginal treatment effect, with a 95% confidence interval, using the
complete cases and the data from the single and multiple imputation are
2.01 (95%CI 0.34, 3.68), 1.68 (95%CI 0.13, 3.23) and 2.05 (95%CI 0.41,
3.69), respectively. The results supported a benefit to quality of life
of the novel targeted blood pressure management protocol compared to the
standard of care.

## 4. Write an abstract of no more than 500 words with an objective, study design and data, methods, results and discussion. Be sure to focus on the objective of the trial, i.e. to evaluate the efficacy of the novel targeted blood pressure management protocol. Provide sufficient details and results from both the complete case and multiple imputation results. And be quantitative in your results section

**Objective** To evaluate the efficacy of novel targeted blood pressure
management protocol (intervention) compared to standard care (control)
in improving patients' quality of life.

**Study design and data** This randomized controlled study involved 250
adult stroke patients, randomly assigned to receive either the novel
protocol or standard care. Using the complete cases and the data from
the single and multiple imputation, we explored the effect of treatment
on the improvement of quality of life.

**Methods** We conducted an exploratory analysis of the missing data in
this stroke trial to explore the patterns of missing data. We compared
the proportion of missing outcomes and the distribution of age and
disease severity for those with and without missing data, considering
the different treatment assignment. To interpolate the missing data, we
conducted a single predicted mean imputation and multiple (M=20)
predicted mean imputation using the observed patients age, condition
severity and treatment assignment as predictors. Then we fit a linear
regression to estimate the marginal treatment effect, adjusting for age
and severity, using the complete cases, single and multiple imputation
data.

**Results** A total of 250 patients participated in the study. The
proportion of missing outcomes was 0.124 overall, 0.173 for standard of
care and 0.073 for the novel protocol group. The mean age was 64.3 (SD
3.84) years for non-missing participants and 64.6 (SD 4.65) for missing
data. Mean severity scores were 10.1 (SD 2.63) for non-missing
participants, and 9.97 (SD 2.43) for missing data. The distribution of
age was different for those with and without missing data (overall and
within treatment group). The marginal treatment effects, with 95%
confidence intervals, were 2.01 (95% CI: 0.34, 3.68) for complete cases,
1.68 (95% CI: 0.13, 3.23) for single imputation, and 2.05 (95% CI: 0.41,
3.69) for multiple imputation.

**Discussion** The results supported a benefit to quality of life of the
novel targeted blood pressure management protocol compared to the
standard care. The multiple imputation result was consistent with the
complete cases analysis. The multiple imputation analysis, designed to
account for the uncertainty due to missing data, provided a comparable
effect size to the complete case analysis. The positive treatment effect
observed in the complete case and imputation analyses suggests that the
novel targeted blood pressure management protocol may be more effective
than the standard of care in improving the quality of life for patients
with hypertension.

## 5. The estimated marginal treatment effect in the trial had there been no missing data was 0.71 (95% CI: -0.96, 2.34, p-value 0.39) (I know this because I simulated the dataset). Explain what may account for the differences between the estimated marginal treatment effect had there been no missing data, based on the complete cases and based on the imputation approach.

Under the scenario with no missing data, the estimated marginal effect
is much smaller than the results above and shows no significance.
Several factors could contribute to this difference:

1)  **Selection Bias:** The observed complete cases only include
    subjects with complete data. If the missing mechanism is not Missing
    Completely At Random (MCAR), analyzing only the complete data can
    introduce bias. Particularly, if the missingness is related to the
    unobserved data (Missing Not At Random, MNAR mechanism), the
    information from the remaining subjects may not accurately represent
    the characteristics of the overall population. This can lead to
    statistical bias, potentially overestimating the effect towards a
    more positive outcome. While multiple imputation may mitigate this
    bias compared to single imputation, it may still broaden the
    confidence interval without fully addressing the issue.

2)  **Limitations of Imputation Methods:** Both single and multiple
    imputation methods assume Missing At Random (MAR) or MCAR and
    utilize linear models for imputation. However, they may not fully
    account for nonlinear relationships and are not robust when these
    assumptions are violated. Consequently, if there are nonlinear
    missing associations or MNAR mechanisms present, the estimated
    results may be heavily skewed.

## 6. If you are working in a group of 2 or 3 students:

a.  Provide the names of your group members Sunan Gao, Chunyu Liu, Siyu
    Zou
b.  Describe your contributions to the analysis, interpretation and
    writing. Each group member provides a version of the results,
    followed by a discussion and subsequent amendments

# III. Connection of logistic regression to 2x2 tables; confounding and effect modification

Upon mastery of this problem, a student should be able to: â€¢ create one
or multiple 2x2 tables from which to estimate log odds ratios that
correspond to coefficients from simple or multiple logistic regressions
â€¢ appreciate the invariance of the odds ratio as one important reason
logistic regression is popular in epidemiology â€¢ pool log odds ratios
across strata using weighted averages as an approximation to logistic
regression

Use the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) data set for this
problem. The general goal is to describe the association of
self-reported smoking with the indicator of major smoking-caused disease
(mscd), a group of diseases the U.S. Surgeon General and WHO say are
caused by smoking.

# Part A: Simple logistic regression

## 1. Define a variable mscd to represent whether or not a person has a major smoking caused disease (e.g. lc5 or chd5 =1). Make a 2x2 table of mscd against eversmk (1-yes; 0-no). Calculate the log odds ratio, its standard error and 95% CI using 652 methods for 2x2 tables. To simplify the analysis, drop those people who have a missing value of eversmk.

```{r}
load("nmes.rdata")
d <- nmes
d[d == "."] <- NA

data1 <- d |>
  filter(!is.na(eversmk)) |>
  mutate(mscd = ifelse(lc5 + chd5 > 0, 1, 0),
         bigexp = ifelse(totalexp > 1000, 1, 0))

tab <- table(macd = data1$mscd, eversmk = data1$eversmk)
tab
a <- tab[2,2]
b <- tab[1,2]
c <- tab[2,1]
d <- tab[1,1]
# logOR <- log((4626*886) / (5739*433))
logOR <- log((a * d) / (b * c))
# standard error and 95% CI
SE <- sqrt(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d)
CI_lower <- logOR - 1.96 * SE 
CI_upper <- logOR + 1.96 * SE

unadjusted_logOR = data.frame( "Log odds ratio" = logOR, "Standard error" = SE, "CI_lower" = CI_lower, "CI_upper" = CI_upper
)
unadjusted_logOR
```

## 2. Regress mscd on eversmk using logistic regression. Compare the regression coefficient and its standard error with the log odds ratio and standard error in Part A Question 1 above.

```{r}
model1 <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk, data = data1, family = "binomial")
summary(model1)

model_logistic = data.frame( "Regression coefficien" = summary(model1)$coefficients["eversmk1", "Estimate"], "Standard error" = summary(model1)$coefficients["eversmk1", "Std. Error"]
)
model_logistic
```

The regression coefficient and its standard error are same to the log
odds ratio and standard error in Part A Question 1 above.

## 3. Use logistic regression to regress eversmk on mscd. Compare the log odds ratio and standard error from this regression with those from Part A Questions 1 and 2.

```{r}
model2 <- glm(as.factor(eversmk) ~ mscd, data = data1, family = binomial)
summary(model2)
model2_reverse = data.frame( "Regression coefficien" = summary(model2)$coefficients["mscd", "Estimate"], "Standard error" = summary(model2)$coefficients["mscd", "Std. Error"]
)
model2_reverse
```

The log odds ratio and standard error from this regression are also same
to the results in Questions 1 and 2.

## 4. Write a couple of sentences that can be used to teach a public health professional a) the interpretation of the logistic regression coefficient, b) the invariance property of the odds ratio and c) why the invarince property is important for public health research (HINT: this about different study designs that may generate data within a 2x2 table)

The logistic regression coefficient means the log odds ratio. In this
result, the logistic regression coefficient is 0.5003868, means the log
odds of major smoking-caused disease (mscd) among those ever smoker are
roughly 0.500 (95% CI 0.379, 0.622) times the log odds among those not
smoking. We can exponentiate the logistic regression coefficient to get
the odds ratio. The odds of having MSCD among those ever smoker are 1.65
times the odds among those ever smoker.

Invariance property of the odds ratio: This means the odds ratio remains
consistent regardless of which variable is the "exposure" and which is
the "outcome". This reveals the link between retrospective
(case-control) and prospective (cohort) studies for the estimation of
risk of disease due to exposure. In prospective study, we took samples
of exposed and unexposed individuals at the beginning of study and
follow them up. With the retrospective (case-control) approach, we
sample according to disease status rather than exposure status.
${{P(D|E)/P(\overline D|E)}\over{ P(D|\overline E)/P(\overline D|\overline E)}} = {{P(E|D)/P(\overline E|D)} \over {P(E|\overline D)/P(\overline E|\overline D)}}.$

Why the invarince property is important for public health research

The OR calculated from a prospective sampling is identical to the OR
from a retrospective sampling. The relative risk, the ratio of disease
incidences, can be approximated by the case-control OR (under the rare
disease assumption), even though the latter provides no information
about the absolute magnitude of the incident rates in the exposed and
unexposed groups. This is particularly important in public health
research because it enables the generalization of results from studies
with different designs, settings, or populations. Whether the data come
from a retrospective (case-control) and prospective (cohort) study, the
odds ratio can provide a consistent measure of association, thus
enhancing the comparability of study findings across diverse public
health contexts.

# Part B. Association of mscd and eversmk, controlling for age.

1.  Stratify age by: \<50, 51-60, 61-70, \>70. Within each stratum,
    calculate the log odds ratio and standard error for the mscd-eversmk
    association. Complete the table below. Here, weight is defined to be
    the inverse of the variance normalized to sum to 1.0 across strata:
    weightj=(1/sej^2)/sumj(1/sej^2)

```{r}
data1$age_stratum <- cut(as.numeric(data1$lastage), 
                         breaks = c(-Inf, 50, 60, 70, Inf),
                         labels = c("<50", "51-60", "61-70", ">70"), right = FALSE)


results <- data.frame(
    age_stratum = c("<50", "51-60", "61-70", ">70"), 
    log_odds_ratio = numeric(4),
    std_error = numeric(4),
    Inverse_se2 = numeric(4),
    weight = numeric(4)
)

log_odds_ratio <- function(subdata) {
  model <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk, data = subdata, family = binomial)
  coefficient <- coef(summary(model))["eversmk1", "Estimate"]
  se <- coef(summary(model))["eversmk1", "Std. Error"]
  return(c(coefficient, se))
}

# Calculate log odds ratio and standard error for each stratum
for (stratum in levels(data1$age_stratum)) {
      subdata <- subset(data1, age_stratum == stratum)
      results[results$age_stratum == stratum, c("log_odds_ratio", "std_error")] <- log_odds_ratio(subdata) }


# Calculate the weights for each stratum
results$Inverse_se2 <- 1 / (results$std_error^2) 
sum_inv_variance <- sum(results$Inverse_se2) 
results$weight <- results$Inverse_se2 / sum_inv_variance
# View the results
print(results)
```

### 2. Calculate the inverse-variance weighted average log odds ratio from the data above and its standard error (SE = sqrt{1/sumj[1/se2j] } ).

Create a plot to compare the age-adjusted log odds ratio to the
unadjusted log-odds ratio from Part A. Question 1, include 95%
confidence intervals in the plot. Add any additional information for
evaluating whether age is a confounder to your figure. Explain in a
sentence or two whether age is a "confounder" of the disease-smoking
association and why?

```{r}
# inverse-variance weighted average log odds ratio
weighted_log_odds_ratio <- sum(results$log_odds_ratio * results$weight)
# standard error for the weighted average log odds ratio 
weighted_se <- sqrt(1 / sum_inv_variance )

plot_data <- data.frame(
  Type = c( "Age-adjusted", "Unadjusted"), 
  Log_OR = c(weighted_log_odds_ratio, unadjusted_logOR$`Log.odds.ratio`),
  SE = c( weighted_se, unadjusted_logOR$`Standard.error`)
)

plot_data$CI_lower <- plot_data$Log_OR - 1.96 * plot_data$SE
plot_data$CI_upper <- plot_data$Log_OR + 1.96 * plot_data$SE 
plot_data
```

```{r}
# Create custom theme
custom_theme <- theme(
  panel.background = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
  axis.line = element_line(size = 0.5)
)

# Visualize in a figure
results1_plot <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(y = factor(Type))) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Log_OR), size = 5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = CI_lower, xmax = CI_upper), linewidth = 0.5, width = 0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(y = "", x = "Log(OR)", title = "Log Odds Ratio for Unadjusted\n and Age-adjusted Models") +
  custom_theme
results1_plot

```

```{r}
# Run the bootstrap
library(boot)
set.seed(653)

# my.boot <- function(dat, x) {
#   d = dat[x,]
#   model1 <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk, data = d, family = "binomial")
#   model3 <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk + as.factor(age_stratum), data = d, family = "binomial")
#   model3$coefficients[2] - model1$coefficients[2]
# }

my.boot <- function(dat, x) {
  d = dat[x,]
  ## (Non)-Weighted-estimate
  d$eversmk = as.numeric(d$eversmk)
  strata_results <- d %>%
    filter(!is.na(eversmk)) %>%
    group_by(age_stratum) %>%
    summarize(
      a = sum(mscd == 1 & eversmk == 1),
      b = sum(mscd == 0 & eversmk == 1),
      c = sum(mscd == 1 & eversmk == 0),
      d = sum(mscd == 0 & eversmk == 0),
      log_or = log((a*d)/(b*c)),
      se = sqrt(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d),
      inv_se2 = 1/se^2
    ) %>%
    mutate(weight = inv_se2 / sum(inv_se2))
  weighted_log_or <- sum(strata_results$log_or * strata_results$weight)
  model1 <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk, data = d, family = "binomial")
  weighted_log_or - model1$coefficients[2]
}

results1_boot <- boot(data1, my.boot, R = 100)
boot.ci(results1_boot, type = "perc")
```

The estimate of the change $\beta_{adjusted}$ - $\beta_{unadjusted}$
=0.18 and a 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval (CI): 0.14 to
0.22. The unadjusted and adjusted estimates are statistically different,
which suggests age may be a confounder.

### 3. Use logistic regression to regress mscd on eversmk and 3 indicator variables for the 4 age strata, i.e. make age category a factor. Compare the resulting eversmk coefficient and standard error with the value above in Part B Question 2.

```{r}

model3 <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk + as.factor(age_stratum), data = data1, family = "binomial")
summary_model3 <- summary(model3)

log_or_model3 <- coef(summary_model3)["eversmk1", "Estimate"]
se_model3 <- coef(summary_model3)["eversmk1", "Std. Error"]

compare <- data.frame(
  model = c("Inverse-variance weighting", "Logistic regression estimation"),
  Log_OR = c(weighted_log_odds_ratio, log_or_model3),
  SE = c(weighted_se, se_model3)
)

compare 
```

The resulting eversmk coefficient and standard error are similar to the
value above in Part B Question 2, calculated by inverse-variance
weighting.

### 4. Now repeat the analysis controlling for age with your favorite smooth function of continuous age.

```{r}
library(splines)
model_continuous <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk +  ns(lastage, df=3), data = data1, family = "binomial")
summary_continuous <- summary(model_continuous)
log_or_continuous <- summary_continuous$coefficients["eversmk1", "Estimate"]
se_continuous <- summary_continuous$coefficients["eversmk1", "Std. Error"]
cat("Age continuous:", log_or_continuous, ", SE:", se_continuous, "\n")
```

### 5. Plot the mscd data against age using the eversmk value as the plotting symbol or color.

Add the predicted values from your model and a kernel smoother fit
separately to each smoking group for comparison.

```{r}
data1$predicted <-  predict(model_continuous, type = "response") 

# Kernel smoother with bandwidth 20 months
data1 <- data1 |>
  arrange(eversmk, lastage, mscd) |>
  mutate(ksmooth_mscd = ksmooth(lastage, mscd, bandwidth = 20)$y) 

ggplot(data1, aes(x = lastage, y = mscd, color = factor(eversmk))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y=predicted, linetype = "Predicted values"), linewidth = 1)  + 
  geom_line(aes(y=ksmooth_mscd, linetype = "Kernel smoother"),  linewidth = 1)  + 
  labs(x = "Age", 
       y = "MSCD",  
       title = "Mscd data against age",
       color = "Smoking Status"
       ) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red"), labels = c("Non-smoker", "Smoker")) +
  custom_theme


```

Compare the model predictions with the kernel smoothers to see if there
is evidence of effect modification of the mscd-smoking association by
age?

Yes, there is effect modification of the mscd-smoking association by
age.

### 6. Propose an extended model to directly address the possibility that age modifies the effect of smoking on disease prevalence.

Fit this model and compare it to the model without effect modification
using a likelihood ratio test.

```{r}
library(splines)
library(lmtest)
model_extend <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk * lastage, data = data1, family = binomial) 
# anova(model_continuous, model_extend, test = "LRT")
model_add<- glm(mscd ~ eversmk  + lastage, data = data1, family = binomial) 
anova(model_add, model_extend, test = "LRT")


model_extend_ns <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk * ns(lastage,df=3), data = data1, family = binomial) 
model_add_ns <- glm(mscd ~ eversmk +  ns(lastage,df=3), data = data1, family = "binomial")
anova(model_extend_ns, model_add_ns, test = "LRT")
```

The likelihood ratio test compares models with age as a confounder
(continuous or natural spline) and age as an effect modifier are not
statistically significant different, with a p-value 0.8006 and 0.1077,
respectively. This indicates that age not significantly modifies the
effect of smoking on disease prevalence.
